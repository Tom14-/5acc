# Results
* Phenotyping
    * panicle morphology (p-trap) from 5 accessions (Â± other accessions?)
    * timing of transitions in developmental stages by histology
* RNA seq
    * Differential expression analysis
        * Simple case: genes that are DE between stages **within** each species
        * Genes that may be involved in domestication
            * the relationship between stage and gene expression is **different** between domesticated and wild species. The differential expression depends on stage AND domestication status (e.g. differentially expressed in multiple/all domesticated accessions)
        * Can ask other questions, e.g. is the relationship between stage and gene expression different in accessions with higher yield, more primary/secondary branches, etc.
        * support candidates e.g. with evidence of selective sweeps or CNV in genomic sequencing data
    * Comparison between the 5 species of expression of genes involved in an interesting pathway, e.g. a hormone pathway, production of a metabolite, a particular TF network, etc.
* Extended expression studies of interesting genes
    * e.g. *in situ*/fluidigm/qPCR analysis of differentially expressed genes in all the developmental stages that were sampled (not just the sequenced stages)
* Hormones/metabolites?
    * if we can relate to DE genes, or to changes in expression between species
